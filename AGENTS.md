# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

<!-- DEV KIT START -->

# Dev Kit

This project uses `@danieljvdm/dev-kit` to manage portable agent skills and reproducible setup from `dev-kit.jsonc` and `dev-kit.lock.json`.

For dev-kit operations, use the `dev-kit` skill and read `skills/dev-kit/SKILL.md` before changing managed outputs.

## Project command policy

Vite+ is the command authority for this repository. This policy takes precedence over generic tool guidance:

- Install dependencies: `vp install`.
- Full validation: `vp run check`.
- Static checks: `vp check`.
- Format check: `vp fmt --check`; format fixes: `vp fmt`.
- Lint only: `vp lint`; lint fixes: `vp lint --fix`.
- Tests only: `vp test`.
- Typecheck only: `vp run typecheck`.
- Other repository tasks and package scripts: `vp run <task>`.

Do not use `bun run`, `npm run`, `pnpm run`, or `yarn run` in this repository. Do not invoke underlying tools such as `tsc`, `vitest`, `oxlint`, or `oxfmt` directly; use the Vite+ entry points above.
